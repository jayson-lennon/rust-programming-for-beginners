// Project 1: Interactive bill manager
//
// User stories:
// * L1: I want to add bills, including the name and amount owed.
// * L1: I want to view existing bills.
// * L2: I want to remove bills.
// * L3: I want to edit existing bills.
// * L3: I want to go back if I change my mind.
//
// Tips:
// * Use the loop keyword to create an interactive menu.
// * Each menu choice should be it's own function, so you can work on the
//   the functionality for that menu in isolation.
// * A vector is the easiest way to store the bills at level 1, but a
//   hashmap will be easier to work with at levels 2 and 3.
// * Create a function just for retrieving user input, and reuse it
//   throughout your program.
// * Create your program starting at level 1. Once finished, advance to the
//   next level.
